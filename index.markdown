Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Davíð Freyr Björnsson and I'm an economist and computer scientist from Iceland. I'm currently pursuing a Masters degree in Data Science at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. I'll publish here some projects of mine and things related to Data Science, Economics or Computer Science that I find interesting.
